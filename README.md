- Please navigate to the web crawling notebook [here](./webcrawling.ipynb)
- The code for crawling is linked [here](./scrapy/sayariproject/spiders/firststop.py)
- Left the output of the crawl (normally would .gitignore it, but decided to leave it [here](./scrapy/output.json))
- Avoided using try/catch statements for assessment purposes
- Simplified Python setup, usually use a `pyproject.toml` or `conda.yml`
